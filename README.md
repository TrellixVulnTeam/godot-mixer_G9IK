**Looking for volunteers to help out. Documentation, coding and general feedback.**

Clone https://gitlab.com/ubisoft-animation-studio/mixer.git and enable it as an addone in Blender.

Clone this repository.

Copy the correct platform blender and put it at the root of the project.

Open stable 3.2 build and launch the project.

Go to the end of new_scene.py and change `example_room` to your username.

When you play the game, it should return true because the room is named.
