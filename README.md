## Mixer Project

**Looking for volunteers to help out. Documentation, coding and general feedback.**

Implementation of https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/851.

## Status 

Not ready, prototyping.

### How to use?

Clone https://gitlab.com/ubisoft-animation-studio/mixer.git and enable it as an addon in Blender.

Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-mixer.git`.

Open stable 3.2 build and launch the project.

Go to the end of new_scene.py and change `example_room` to your username.

When you play the game, it should return true because the room is named.
